Implement a grid that displays 1 column on mobile (< 640px), 2-3 columns on tablet (640px-1024px), and 3-4 columns on desktop (>= 1024px). Use Tailwind grid utilities (grid, grid-cols-1, sm:grid-cols-2, md:grid-cols-3, lg:grid-cols-4) with consistent gap spacing (gap-4 or gap-6). Apply the grid layout to the image container within each tab's content area, ensuring all four categories (home, office, commercial, outdoor) render images in the same responsive grid structure. Maintain the existing click handlers for opening the lightbox dialog."

For the Home category, use paths like /assets/generated/home-1.dim_800x600.png through /assets/generated/home-15.dim_800x600.png (15 images available based on assets list). For Commercial category, generate paths for commercial-1 through commercial-30. For Office category, generate paths for office-1 through office-30. For Hotels category, generate paths for hotels-1 through hotels-30. Ensure the image path generation logic correctly maps category names to their corresponding filename prefixes and includes the .dim_800x600.png dimension suffix. Verify that the thumbnail images in the grid and the full-size images in the lightbox dialog both reference valid asset paths. Note: The assets list shows 15 home images are actually available; adjust the Home category to display only available images or update logic to handle missing images gracefully across all categories."
