# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix portfolio gallery image loading and implement responsive grid layout.

**Planned changes:**
- Update PortfolioGallery component to use responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2-3 tablet, 3-4 desktop)
- Fix broken image paths to correctly reference /assets/generated/ directory using public asset paths
- Ensure all 120 portfolio images load correctly across all four categories

**User-visible outcome:** Portfolio images display in a clean, responsive grid layout without broken image icons, adapting smoothly across all device sizes.
