- Maintain existing dialog-based lightbox pattern and luxury design aesthetic

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse interior design portfolio organized by project type (Home, Commercial, Office, Hotels), view 30 images per category, and see detailed titles and descriptions when clicking on any image.
