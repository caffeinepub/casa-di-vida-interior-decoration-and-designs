However, the implementation only shows 30 images for the Home category (visible in truncated content), and evidence for the remaining 90 images across Commercial, Office, and Hotels categories is missing due to truncation. Cannot verify full compliance with REQ-11's requirement for 120 total images without complete diff content.",
